# Customize

There are multiple ways to customize RS(Responsive Style). Your best path can depend on your project, the complexity of your build tools, the version of RS you’re using, browser support, and more.

Our two preferred methods are:

- Using RS via package manager so you can use and extend our source files.
- Using RS's compiled distribution files or jsDelivr so you can add onto or override Bootstrap’s styles.
